A Turing machine that can run (almost) any instruction set.

## Installation

Install it with:

    $ gem install turing_machine

## Usage

Look at some well-known instruction set in [instruction_sets](instruction_sets)
or create your own. Then run the Turing machine with, for example: 

    $ turing_machine instruction_sets/busy_beaver_1
