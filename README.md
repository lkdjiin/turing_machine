A Turing machine that can run (almost) (one day maybe) (I hope) any instruction set.

## Installation

Install it with:

    $ gem install turing_machine

## Usage

Look at some well-known instruction sets in [instruction_sets](instruction_sets)
or create your own. Then run the Turing machine with, for example:

    $ turing_machine instruction_sets/busy_beaver_1

To initialize the tape with some data, use `--tape`:

    $ turing_machine instruction_sets/copy --tape 111

Finally, look at the
[InstructionsParser class](lib/turing_machine/instructions_parser.rb) for a
documentation of the instruction format if you want to write your own.
